# KNN-by-C

Introduction :

In this project , A machine learning classification algorithm K-nearest neighbors(KNN) is implementing in C-language.
For implementation ,We are using The Iris dataset.The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning. Dataset is in form of .CSV file.
The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each, and then four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

Predicted Attribute: Different Species of Iris plant.

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to gain introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with C-language.
